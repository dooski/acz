# Animal Crossing Zine

## About
The Animal Crossing Zine was put together by Dan McKeon and Pretty Cool Poetry Thing over the course of about a year and a half or so. We always wanted to make a poetry collection of Animal Crossing-centric writing, and the announcement and release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons really gave us the fire to actually get this project going. We originally planned for this to be another print zine among our general issues, but in January we came to the tough decision to end PCPT after publishing the Animal Crossing collection. Then the pandemic hit and really knocked the wind out of our sails. We reopened submissions for new poems about Animal Crossing, given this wild new context we were now living and playing in. That's when we also decided to make this issue our real last hurrah, to go out with a bang and with something special. So we made this: a website where our beloved Bart the Chameleon becomes a villager and guides you through a virtual reading of all poems Animal Crossing.

            JavaScript,
            HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Node.js. Bart's voiceovers were built off of Acedio's <a

            to approximate the speech functions. CSS was built off of some of the elements from <a

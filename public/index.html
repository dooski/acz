                    <p>It’s the morning of Animal Crossing Direct<br>
                        but I can’t wake up in time. Such simple acts<br>
                        can feel this way. Last night, I listen to the book<br>
                        Know My Name by Chanel Miller, set a sleep timer,<br>
                        let her voice lull me to sleep. I’m desensitized <br>
                        to this kind of lullaby: the story of Emily Doe, <br>
                        not that Emily Doe, but each one, emerging<br>
                        like an apparition, an unexpected villager, <br>
                        a colonizer. When Chanel says Philadelphia,<br>
                        I wake up. Everything happens so close <br>
                        to home. This is my worst habit: <br>
                        I roll over and check my phone<br>
                        in the middle of the night. On Twitter,<br>
                        AOC slays Mystic7, the Pokémon Go Youtuber.<br>
                        I check to see if there’s anything new<br>
                        in my Pokémon Home wonder box. I fulfill <br>
                        requests on Pocket Camp. I’m so good<br>
                        at fulfilling expectations. Everything will coalesce, <br>
                        eventually. To make space for the coincidence – <br>
                        to cross paths with me on Walnut Street,<br>
                        another Emily Doe, and then another, <br>
                        and another. To reproduce one Emily Doe <br>
                        across every island, every console, a character <br>
                        stripped of herself, who lives in all of us. <br>
                        We know how to shrink. We know how <br>
                        the story ends. Zoe texts: OOOO eventually <br>
                        u get a construction permit and can change <br>
                        the landscape of your island!!!!! & I imagine <br>
                        Emily Doe shaping all of us, envy the ability <br>
                        to cut out these parts of me. I want to write<br>
                        a poem about Animal Crossing that is not<br>
                        actually about trauma, about Emily. <br>
                        How nothing can distract me<br>
                        the way Isabelle can. How I don’t have <br>
                        the capacity, too many items in my market box. <br>
                        How even Tom Nook can’t expand my body,<br>
                        build extra space for this burden, these burdens. <br>

                        and Animal Crossing: New Leaf<br>
                        on one of his good days. On one of his<br>

                        you mean everything to me days.<br><br>

                        I played through his rage blackouts. The<br>
                        bathroom door was the only door in the apartment<br>
                        that locked so I played on the floor. Kept<br>
                        an extra charger under the sink.<br><br>

                        I played and I played and I kept playing<br>

                        what if all it does is remind me of him?<br>
                        The way he’d hold my neck against the wall<br>
                        followed by baby I’m so sorry. Followed by<br>
                        I swear it’ll never happen again.<br><br>

                        It always happened again and I would<br>
                        always find solace in New Leaf,<br>
                        a place where no one ever necklaced <br>
                        their hands around my throat. A place<br>
                        where safety was manufactured but real. <br><br>

                        It’s been three years and I can still feel his hands.<br>
                        It’s been three years and I don’t know<br>

                        nestled amidst dense suburban bustling communities.<br>

                        Do you ever wonder why that is?<br><br>

                        It's that calming kind of presence I know of Autumn,<br>
                        witnessing the end of something lovely before it plunges into night.<br>
                        I find myself visiting these places often,<br>
                        and fondly reminiscing about the other places that I've been.<br>
                        Villages I've left to fend against the whims of time,<br>
                        like trying to remember the face of a friend from long ago. <br>
                        It's an approximation of what came before...<br>
                        just more weeds now, I suppose. <br><br>

                        So what does it mean when a time capsule ages?<br>
                        As years pass, is there a serenity in knowing what's possible?<br>
                        I hope my friends forgive me when I visit somewhere new. <br>
                        Just like my friends before,<br>
                        and before,<br>
                        and before.

                    <hr>
                    <p>isabelle said i’d been gone for weeks.<br><br>

                        in my absence, the town was overgrown.<br>
                        i spent the afternoon in bed, pulling the weeds,<br>
                        obsessively transposing flowers <br>
                        so the cosmos did not interrupt the rows of roses<br>
                        i had planted by my house last year.<br><br>

                        my favorite lion moved away, but the koalas stayed.<br>
                        good friends leave, but sometimes that’s okay.<br>
                        a new cat came to town and built herself a home<br>
                        a little left of my cherry tree grove<br>
                        in a spot i’d meant to put a clock tower in.<br>
                        that transgression, i did not mind so much.<br><br>

                        mom sent me a letter.<br>
                        peanut asked where i had been.<br>
                        alice said i’d changed a bit,<br>
                        i looked a little different from the last time i was here,<br>
                        in need of a haircut, a change of clothes.<br>
                        she’s right, it’s been a moment since i’ve been alright,<br>
                        but bad times are just times that are bad,<br>
                        and i feel i’m coming to the end of mine. <br><br>

                        i think my friends have missed me.<br>
                        i think that i will be missed.

                        You hung around mine! You never asked to be roommates (unlike the funny rabbit) but I wish

                        had and that I could have said yes! <br>

                        You showed me how to be kind again.<br>
                        Coco, if you hadn’t moved out,<br>
                        I probably would have failed all of my senior year tests,<br>

                        you were always braver, more adventurous<br><br>

                        starlit walks, lying on our fronts in a tent<br>
                        and in the morning your father<br>

                        waved hot rolls before our faces to wake us up.<br><br>

                        sat on the school bus, bags resting primly in our laps<br>

                        royal. what even is that word?<br><br>

                        we were headstrong girls, bound<br><br>

                        the same street, <br>
                        and dislike of your younger sister<br><br>

                        remember the love letters <br>
                        i wrote to Angus?<br>
                        i liked him because my dad liked AC/DC<br><br>

                        we laughed ourselves silly when the letters circulated<br>
                        around town. he was so mad, do you remember? <br>
                        and i so hungry to be loved<br><br>

                        some nights we’d be sitting, side by side<br>
                        on the floor of my room<br>
                        and i’d give my world to you to hold<br><br>

                        Shining like the surface of the moon,<br>
                        And eyes alight with laughter, captured in a moment. <br><br>

                        And then, a squirrel. <br><br>

                        Her uni-brow and wonky teeth, <br>
                        Part of what makes her character so cute, <br>
                        Cute - not repulsive.<br>
                        She doesn't comment about her features. <br>
                        And doesn't change them. <br><br>

                        She lives in a slice of paradise;<br>
                        Loved by her neighbours <br>
                        Where it’s okay for squirrels to wear heavy blush,<br>
                        With a tracksuit, and have a uni-brow.<br>
                        Nobody cares about your appearance in an island of animals.<br><br>

                        She enjoys the world around her:<br>
                        Wears what she wants,<br>
                        Does what she wants,<br>
                        Plants flowers,<br>
                        Sings off-key and dances.<br><br>

                        I'm genuinely envious of a squirrel. <br><br>

                        One day at a time,<br>
                        I must face my brows in the mirror;<br>
                        Grimacing as I push glasses higher on my face,<br>
                        Covering the hairs desperate to cross no man's land<br>
                        And embrace in a thin, fleeting embrace. <br><br>

                        They've never managed to touch.<br>
                        I’ve refused to let them meet,<br>
                        I've seared my face with razors, creams and tweezers. <br>
                        Mocked for furrowing them<br>
                        Because they’d “look like they’re touching”.<br><br>

                        I tried to wax them with cello-tape once.<br>
                        The efforts of a desperate and insecure teen,<br>
                        Unable to voice her worries at home.<br>
                        Her sister looked up to her.<br>
                        She had to think she’s pretty.<br><br>

                        And pray she never heard what they said in the halls. <br><br>

                        I never expected to be looking at a squirrel for body confidence.<br>
                        But I spend hours glaring at my brows; <br>
                        Willing them to recoil from each other’s touch,<br>
                        Turn into the caterpillars I was told they resembled <br>
                        And leave my face. <br><br>

                        But I have nowhere to be. <br>
                        The only person I’m seeing is my reflection in the fridge,<br>
                        So why not let them have their moment,<br>
                        On the bridge of my nose. <br>
                        Isolation, like affairs end abruptly. <br><br>

                        But for now, I’m letting the hair grow,<br>
                        Letting lovers meet and spend their days together. <br>
                        I don't know how long this will last,<br>
                        But, when I turn on the game <br>
                        I'm reminded that my brows are lovely.<br><br>

                        No matter if I choose to change them or not.

                    <p>We stockpile supplies at our meager campsite: <br>
                        pears, preserves, snapper. We craft lattice <br>
                        walls and lace them to brittle hedges. I tell you <br>
                        it’s to stall the new winds from the Hollow <br>
                        but really, it’s for our protection. <br><br>

                        Soon, the peaches are slush and attract <br>
                        purring fruit flies. We eat them in a sweet <br>
                        stew with fruit beetles and ground butterfly <br>
                        wings to taste.<br><br>

                        You tell me: Last night I heard the intimacy of a <br>
                        mouth, its slick and swallow, just outside<br>
                        the walls. I tell you the village has already <br>
                        fallen. Yet, I’m unsettled.<br><br>

                        Next night, I head to shore<br>
                        with my fishing rod and boning knife. <br>
                        I should tell you when I leave camp <br>
                        but I get a seductive thrill from wandering <br>
                        on my own at midnight.<br><br>

                        I perch on the rotting pier <br>
                        and cast out. The salt-shaken breeze<br>
                        shudders my spine. I look over my shoulder <br>
                        more than once.<br><br>

                        Hours pass before I feel a tug. As I reel <br>
                        her in, I contemplate the lost days of breakneck <br>
                        fishing and enough mackerel to feed <br>
                        us for weeks.<br><br>

                        I slop the catch at my feet. Moonlight <br>
                        blotches putrid remains: clumps of purple <br>
                        fur clinging to pitted flesh. She’s not good <br>
                        for eating. I use the toe of my pumps to nudge <br>
                        the cat back with a slosh.

                    <p>You thought she was so nice<br>
                        and invited her to live on our island<br>
                        sometimes we talk about you<br><br>

                        She wonders if you’re okay<br><br>

                        This is the farm I am planting<br>
                        cherries and oranges<br>
                        for you to sell<br>
                        I haven’t found peaches<br>
                        but I want to plant those too<br><br>

                        I peruse the shop and wonder<br>
                        would you wear this?<br>
                        use this?<br>
                        would this wallpaper match your bedroom set?<br>
                        or is it the thought that counts?<br><br>

                        I bought two jackets and two hats<br>
                        so we can match<br><br>

                        I sent them to you from the airport<br>
                        I hate typing ‘I miss you’<br>
                        one letter at a time<br>
                        sometimes I type ‘I miss u’ instead<br>
                        isn’t it the thought that counts?<br><br>

                        These are the flowers you planted<br>
                        this is the house you placed by the river<br>
                        sometimes I go inside<br>
                        and admire the pattern you made for the floor<br>
                        I never thought these dots<br>
                        could make me miss you more

                    <p>I manage to catch a fish. It <br>
                        is worthless but I present it <br>
                        anyways. I rattle at the base <br>

                        pears instead. A girl I love <br>
                        promises cherries in a week. <br>
                        Seven days is days more than <br>
                        I can afford sometimes. I drop <br>
                        a handful of red petals to make <br>
                        room for the fish. They are <br>
                        snatches of cotton, scattering <br>
                        across a combed lawn. I wonder<br>
                        if the fish is worth it, slow moving<br>
                        under a protective wall of plastic. <br>
                        I position of the fish by the beach. <br>
                        Let it swim lazy circles, separate<br>
                        from a wild stretch. Is it worth it<br>
                        I try to ask. The fish doesn’t answer. <br>
                        I think that might be my answer, <br>
                        after all <br>

                        my heart hung outside a museum in Philadelphia<br>
                        where my mother last looked sane with love. <br>
                        My mother speaks in chances, mostly in those <br>
                        she didn’t have, that she wants me to take for her.<br>
                        My mother lies, blue-silly-string strung out <br>
                        over ceiling fan, laced over her apron and zirconia studs,<br>
                        and I rub my thumbs over my GameCube controller,<br>
                        a wishing lamp with just enough magic left <br>
                        to pour me into a pixelated place where living and loving are fair.<br>
                        In another home, I plant gardens of cosmos<br>
                        instead of the cucumbers we pickle all Saturday<br>
                        to place on frozen, food-bank burgers.<br>
                        In another home, another mother writes me love letters<br>
                        from a night where the light isn’t blue. <br>
                        On the drive home from the trip my mother saved<br>
                        eight months of tips for, she glistens with sweat, <br>
                        itches her arms in pace with turn signals. <br>
                        I watch leaves blur in the colors of a home-cooked meal<br>
                        and, at the stoplight, my mother turns to me and cups my face, says<br>
                        <i>We came to the city of our leaders because I want you to become one.<br>
                            You, unlike me, will get to be you.</i> <br><br>

                        your body like an erotic novel. <br>
                        Your shirt is sticking to you, and <br>
                        your sleek brown coat is puffed <br>
                        and dulled with the dust. They <br>

                        word I say, think I’m a joke. I <br>
                        can’t do it anymore – so don’t. <br>
                        We lie on the checkered duvet <br>
                        of our Modern Bed to sleep. <br>
                        No doubt, he dreams of a future <br>
                        with autosave functions and a <br>
                        million-bell retirement plan. <br>
                        I dream of seeing him from the <br>
                        waist down.

                        thirties and have a house with a yard and a way <br>
                        more reliable income, and live with my partner <br>
                        and a dog called Matthew. Matthew will be large <br>
                        or medium-sized, and will probably have darker <br>
                        hair, probably black, and maybe I’ll have a car. <br>
                        I have a hat with K.K.’s face on, not in real life <br>
                        but in the game, put it on campers if they’re nice.

                        playing this same game at 3 a.m.<br>
                        when my rhinestone-studded Tracfone lit up.<br><br>

                        It was a car accident:<br>
                        speeding, drinking, dark country roads.<br><br>

                        We didn’t even talk all that much,<br>
                        but I still look up at the same moon<br>
                        that looked down on them that night<br>
                        and I wish they were here<br>
                        to build their homes<br>
                        and befriend their neighbors<br>

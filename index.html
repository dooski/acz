                        I roll over and check my phone<br>
                        in the middle of the night. On Twitter,<br>
                        AOC slays Mystic7, the Pokémon Go Youtuber.<br>
                        I check to see if there’s anything new<br>
                        in my Pokémon Home wonder box. I fulfill <br>
                        requests on Pocket Camp. I’m so good<br>
                        at fulfilling expectations. Everything will coalesce, <br>
                        eventually. To make space for the coincidence – <br>
                        to cross paths with me on Walnut Street,<br>
                        another Emily Doe, and then another, <br>
                        and another. To reproduce one Emily Doe <br>
                        across every island, every console, a character <br>
                        stripped of herself, who lives in all of us. <br>
                        We know how to shrink. We know how <br>
                        the story ends. Zoe texts: OOOO eventually <br>
                        u get a construction permit and can change <br>
                        the landscape of your island!!!!! & I imagine <br>
                        Emily Doe shaping all of us, envy the ability <br>
                        to cut out these parts of me. I want to write<br>
                        a poem about Animal Crossing that is not<br>
                        actually about trauma, about Emily. <br>
                        How nothing can distract me<br>
                        the way Isabelle can. How I don’t have <br>
                        the capacity, too many items in my market box. <br>
                        How even Tom Nook can’t expand my body,<br>
                        build extra space for this burden, these burdens. <br>

                        and Animal Crossing: New Leaf<br>
                        on one of his good days. On one of his<br>
                        apology days. On one of his baby,<br>
                        you mean everything to me days.<br><br>

                        I played through his rage blackouts. The<br>
                        bathroom door was the only door in the apartment<br>
                        that locked so I played on the floor. Kept<br>
                        an extra charger under the sink.<br><br>

                        I played and I played and I kept playing<br>
                        but now I’m sort of dreading<br>
                        the new Animal Crossing game because<br>
                        what if all it does is remind me of him?<br>
                        The way he’d hold my neck against the wall<br>
                        followed by baby I’m so sorry. Followed by<br>
                        I swear it’ll never happen again.<br><br>

                        It always happened again and I would<br>
                        always find solace in New Leaf,<br>
                        a place where no one ever necklaced <br>
                        their hands around my throat. A place<br>
                        where safety was manufactured but real. <br><br>

                        It’s been three years and I can still feel his hands.<br>
                        It’s been three years and I don’t know<br>
                        if I’m ready for Animal Crossing again.<br>

                    <hr>
                    <p>isabelle said i’d been gone for weeks.<br><br>

                        in my absence, the town was overgrown.<br>
                        i spent the afternoon in bed, pulling the weeds,<br>
                        obsessively transposing flowers <br>
                        so the cosmos did not interrupt the rows of roses<br>
                        i had planted by my house last year.<br><br>

                        my favorite lion moved away, but the koalas stayed.<br>
                        good friends leave, but sometimes that’s okay.<br>
                        a new cat came to town and built herself a home<br>
                        a little left of my cherry tree grove<br>
                        in a spot i’d meant to put a clock tower in.<br>
                        that transgression, i did not mind so much.<br><br>

                        mom sent me a letter.<br>
                        peanut asked where i had been.<br>
                        alice said i’d changed a bit,<br>
                        i looked a little different from the last time i was here,<br>
                        in need of a haircut, a change of clothes.<br>
                        she’s right, it’s been a moment since i’ve been alright,<br>
                        but bad times are just times that are bad,<br>
                        and i feel i’m coming to the end of mine. <br><br>

                        i think my friends have missed me.<br>
                        i think that i will be missed.
